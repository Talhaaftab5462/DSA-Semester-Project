## 📦 Game Inventory Manager (C++ – Singly Linked List)

A simple console-based Game Inventory Management System implemented using a manual singly linked list in C++.
Created as a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) project.

This application allows users to:

- Add new inventory items

- Remove items

- Search for items

- Update item quantities

- Display all stored items

Each item is stored as a node in a linked list, demonstrating dynamic memory management and pointer traversal.
